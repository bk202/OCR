1.How to use the program
To run or compile the program would require Opencv 3.0. Download Opencv 3.0 at https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/3.0.0/.
After extracting the library, go to project configuration and set include directories to the location of Opencv.

There are 5 test images included in the folder(Test_image, Test_image2, ... , Test_image5).
To exmaine the output of each test image, go to Source.cpp line 115 to change the name of input image path.
Modify the distance threshold for blob detection of each input image.
To modify distance threshold:
- go to Header.h
- modify the value of the two macro variables: _Distance_TH_H and _Distance_TH_L

the distance threshold for each input images are:
Test_image:
TH_H:20
TH_L:10

Test_image2:
TH_H: 10
TH_L: 4

Test_image3:
TH_H: 10
TH_L: 3

Test_image4:
TH_H: 14
TH_L: 2


Test_image5:
TH_H: 15
TH_L: 10

After running the program, window will pop up to confirm the blobs are correctly labelled. Close the window and
wait for program to process.

2.Codes to look at:

EHD construction:
Examine the class BaseTemplate in Template.cpp
in the cosntructor of BaseTemplate, EHD and the bounding box method are constructed.

The class TemplateSet is a class of sample characters.

Blob detection:
class Labeler contains methods for blob detection.

classification:
The Match() method in class Labeler is responsible for classifying the character of each input blob.
The function scanLine() in class Labeler is the implementation of scan line method.
